            <p>The CELLR app is the destination for users to curate every aspect of their wine life.</p>
            <p>
              Wine has become such an integral part of our social, food, and travel life that it 
              deserves to have a tool to reference all the wines we are lucky enough to experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether users want to inventory the holdings of their cellar, keep track of their 
              wish list when they travel and dine, trade with other cellar owners, or just receive 
              the occasional special that is aligned with their tastes, CELLR will be that destinationâ€¦
            </p>
            <p>
